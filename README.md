# UdaciCards Project

For the UdaciCards project, we build a mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. Users will be able to create decks and flashcards to those decks. The user can take quizzes on those decks and get the percentage correct when the quiz is complete.

This mobile application is developed to work on IOS and Android and had been tested in:
  * Iphone 5c (iOS 10.3.3)
  * Vernee Mars Pro (Android 7.0)

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
